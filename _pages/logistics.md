Course readings will primarily include published research papers from top-tier ML venues (such as JMLR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, COLM) and ACL$$^{*}$$ venues (such as TACL, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL), provided as PDFs.

Additional useful NLP and deep learning texts include:

### Academic accommodations

Virginia Tech welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. The University promotes efforts to provide equal access and a culture of inclusion without altering the essential elements of coursework. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers that may be due to disability, including but not limited to, chronic medical conditions, Deaf or hard of hearing, learning disability, mental health, or vision impairment, please contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) (540-231-3788, <a href="mailto:ssd@vt.edu" target="_blank">ssd@vt.edu</a>, or visit <a href="https://ssd.vt.edu/">www.ssd.vt.edu</a>). If you have an SSD accommodation letter, please meet with us privately during office hours as early in the semester as possible to discuss implementing your accommodations. You must give us reasonable notice to implement your accommodations, which is generally 5 business days and 10 business days for final exams or project presentations.

If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let us know as soon as possible. Together we will develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

### VT Principles of Community statement

Virginia Tech is a public land-grant university, committed to teaching and learning, research, and outreach to the Commonwealth of Virginia, the nation, and the world community. Learning from the experiences that shape Virginia Tech as an institution, we acknowledge those aspects of our legacy that reflected bias and exclusion. Therefore, we adopt and practice the following principles as fundamental to our on-going efforts to increase access and inclusion and to create a community that nurtures learning and growth for all of its members:

- <b>We affirm</b> the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.
- <b>We affirm</b> the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely. We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.
- <b>We affirm</b> the value of human diversity because it enriches our lives and the University. We acknowledge and respect our differences while affirming our common humanity.
- <b>We reject</b> all forms of prejudice and discrimination, including those based on age, color, disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take individual and collective responsibility for helping to eliminate bias and discrimination and for increasing our own understanding of these issues through education, training, and interaction with others.
- <b>We pledge</b> our collective commitment to these principles in the spirit of the Virginia Tech motto of Ut Prosim (<i>That I May Serve</i>).
