### Textbooks

For NLP fundamentals, we recommend [Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky and Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). Course readings will primarily include published research papers from top-tier ML venues (such as JMLR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, COLM) and ACL$$^{*}$$ venues (such as TACL, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL), provided as PDFs.

Additional useful NLP and deep learning texts include:

- [Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing by Manning and Sch√ºtze](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262133609/foundations-of-statistical-natural-language-processing/).
- [Introduction to Natural Language Processing by Eisenstein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262042840/introduction-to-natural-language-processing/). [Draft](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)
- [Dive into Deep Learning by Zhang, Lipton, Li, and Smola](https://d2l.ai/)
