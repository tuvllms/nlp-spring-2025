Course readings will primarily include published research papers from top-tier ML venues (such as JMLR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, COLM) and ACL$$^{*}$$ venues (such as TACL, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL), provided as PDFs.

Additional useful NLP and deep learning texts include:

- [Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing by Manning and Sch√ºtze](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262133609/foundations-of-statistical-natural-language-processing/).
