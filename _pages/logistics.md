### Textbooks

For NLP fundamentals, we recommend the January 2025 release of [Speech and Language Processing (3$$^{rd}$$ ed.) by Jurafsky and Martin](web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). Course readings will primarily include published research papers from top-tier ML (such as JMLR, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, COLM) and ACL$$^{*}$$ (such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL) venues, provided as PDFs.
